You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  C:\Users\muhammad.ansar\Downloads\Multiple_Choice_Quiz_ReactJS-main\Multiple_Choice_Quiz_ReactJS-main

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

[info] 
=== Project Setup
[info] 
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.

[info] 
[info] Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
[info] will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
[info] have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.
